The PO/POT files contained within this directory are intended to make it easier for translators to help with developing phpMussel.

These files correspond to the `lang.%%.php` files contained within the `/%phpMussel%/vault/lang/*` directory of phpMussel, responsible for containing/handling the language data for phpMussel.

These files can be opened and edited directly using either [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) or [POEdit](https://poedit.net/).

Alternatively, phpMussel is registered as an open-source project with [POEditor.com](https://poeditor.com/projects/view?id=43787), and changes may be committed there by those interested in the platform and/or in helping.
